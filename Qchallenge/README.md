## This is Eve.
 ![quantum-ewa](../images/q3.png)   
<br>
<br>

## Eve is working as a cop and she loves math - deadly combination. Something strange is happening recently... A series of murders somehow connected to those strange device chips. One word is repeated over and over in this investigation - 'quantum'. 


 ![quantum-ewa](../images/q4.png)  
<br>
<br>

## You need to help Eve understand what quantum is. Solve all tasks in Episode 1 notebook:
* [Episode 1 jupyter notebook](https://ibm.box.com/s/lrxkb7soskfuitijfehfmik2pya92w6s)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## This quantum related instestigation has gained some attention from the top. Eve has just got a partner to help her (or spy on her?).

<br>

## Now let's help Robert and Eve to get deeper into quantum knowledge. Solve all tasks in Episode 2 notebook:
* [Episode 2 jupyter notebook](https://ibm.box.com/s/lrxkb7soskfuitijfehfmik2pya92w6s)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Eve and Robert did some research and they decided to pay a visit to The Hacker. Long story short - there is organization called X claiming that quantum is dangerous technology that will eventually kill us all.
![quantum-working-together](../images/q7.png) 

## X believes that governments are already working on independend AI based on quantum and this AI will lead us to technological singularity and extinction of human race. The mission of X is to stop it. That's why they are killing quantum researchers and engineers!

## The Hacker gave Eve a code snippet to run the strange chip that Eve have found. X members are communicating between each other using this device. Eve and Robert need another portion of quantum knowledge to hack it and get into X ogranization. Help them by solving this notebook:
* [Episode 3 jupyter notebook](https://ibm.box.com/s/lrxkb7soskfuitijfehfmik2pya92w6s)

<br>
<br>
<br>


## What the hack! Robert is a member o X!

<br>

## Robert came to a conclusion that Eve is a danger for X. He wants to warn his bosses in X.

![quantum-robert](../images/q11.png) 
## So Robert ran away. The last chance for Eve is to reveal X members' identities to the Police (Milicja Obywatelska). This must be done before Robert will get in touch with X:

## Congratulations.
## You have made it. X members are arrested. The future of quantum is shiny. Get involved and make the quantum advantage the reality!
